# te

te is a text editor

small and simple

draws inspiration from ed

it only edits text

no feature creep no bloat

just edit text

end description

# building

make

recommend musl for small size

gnu libc is fat

compilers besides gcc fine too

put wherever you want

static linking fine

do not use glibc for that

it will be very bloated

that all

# why

why not
